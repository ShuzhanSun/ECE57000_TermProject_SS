# ECE57000_TermProject_SS
Term project for course Purdue ECE 57000 Artificial Intelligence, Fall 2018.

## Brief Summary
This term project implemented Spatial Transformer Networks (STNs) ([Jaderberg et al. 2015][Jaderberg2015]). Quantitative effects of STNs to neural networks, on the aspects of model accuracy, converging speed, and model stability to initial conditions, are tested by embedding a single STN into Two Layer Perceptron (TLP) networks. Details are in the [report](/Report/ECE570_TermPaper_Shuzhan Sun.pdf).
