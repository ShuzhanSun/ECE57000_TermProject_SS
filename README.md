# ECE57000_TermProject_SS
Term project for course Purdue ECE 57000 Artificial Intelligence, Fall 2018.

## Brief Summary
This term project implemented Spatial Transformer Networks (STNs) ([Jaderberg et al. 2015][Jaderberg2015]). Quantitative effects of STNs to neural networks, on the aspects of model accuracy, converging speed, and model stability to initial conditions, are tested by embedding a single STN into Two Layer Perceptron (TLP) networks. Details are in the [report][Report_PDF].

## Acknowledgments
The TLP codes are adopted and modified from the course instructor [Professor Jeffrey Mark Siskind][Prof_Jef]. Here is his [GitHub repository][Git_Jef].
